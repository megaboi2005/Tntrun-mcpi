# Tntrun-mcpi
a little tnt run clone for mcpi xD

Its not automated so if you want to restart the game you have to close the script and open it again. 
# THIS WORKS WITH MULTIPLAYER 
so if you want to play with friends you can and in fact if you get a android buddy to download 0.6.1 alpha mcpe they can connect to the server through lan 
(the only issue is if they fall the chat will be spammed because mcpe didn't have a teleport system)

# Known issues
1. Not automated
1. generation of maps kinda lags the server (may fix with generation of certain areas
1. server is laggy for some reason sometimes 
1. mcpe users can't teleport when in the void so they die xD (can't fix)
1. when someone falls in the void everyone teleports up for some reason (idk it was acting like that during testing, if you have a second pi can you test it for me.)
1. this crashes raspberry juice servers 
# about
This is my first mcpi project and I plan to make bigger and badder ones in the future. I take any pull requests or issues submitted and I really don't care if you fork it.
